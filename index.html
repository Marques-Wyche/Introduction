<h1>sandwich time i guess</h1>
<br>
<h3>Step one: Grab a small sum of cash to buy some bread, and other ingredients. Then go over to your local grocery store I reccomend Publix or Walmart. Remember that anything can be on your sandwich!</h3>
<br>
<h3>step two: CAREFULLY place your bread on a plate. The bread has feelings too. Then, aquire your other ingredients to add onto the sandwich. </h3>
<br>
<h4> disclaimer. this next step is the most intense, stress inducing step of them all. if you are worried, please proceed with caution.</h4>
<br>
<h3> step three: place your ingredients on the bread in whatever order you please. (Recommended, bread on the outside) after that, pick up the newly created specimen known as the sandwich, then give it a name like sandwichathy or something. Naming things is fun. </h3>
<h3>step four: taste your sandwich to see if it is delectable. if so, smile and have a good day. Go outside and enjoy life. If not, dont be sad because you can also try again. </h3>
