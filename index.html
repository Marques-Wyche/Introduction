<h1>sandwich time i guess</h1>
<br>
<h3>Step one:Go to your local supermarket, I reccomend Publix.also buy bread. and ham and cheese and whatever you think should be on your sandwich because in my eyes, your opinion matters.</h3>
<br>
<h3>step two: CAREFULLY place your bread on a plate. also get your other ingredients.</h3>
<br>
<h4> disclaimer. this next step is the most intense, stress inducing step of them all. if you are worried, please proceed with caution.</h4>
<br>
<h3> step three: place your ingredient on the bread in whatever order you please. after that, pick up the newly created specimen known as the sandwich</h3>
<h3>step four: taste your sandwich to see if it is delectable. if so, smile and have a good day. if not, dont be sad because you can also try again. </h3>
